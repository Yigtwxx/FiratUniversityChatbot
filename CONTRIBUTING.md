# Contributing to FiratUniversityChatbot 🚀

First of all, thank you for being here! Whether you're fixing a typo or rewriting a whole retrieval pipeline, your help makes this project better for every student at Fırat University.

Since we want to keep the code clean and the bot running smoothly, I have a few friendly guidelines to help us work together effectively.

## 🛠 The Workflow (How to Contribute)

To keep the `main` branch stable, I follow a standard open-source workflow. Please don't try to push changes directly to the `main` branch of this repository. Instead:

1. **Fork the Repo:** Click that "Fork" button at the top to create your own copy of the project.
2. **Create a Feature Branch:** This is important! Before you start coding, create a new branch in your fork for your specific task:
* `git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-logic` or `git checkout -b fix/annoying-bug`.
* **Note:** Please keep your fork’s `main` branch clean and synced with the original project. Only work in your feature branches.


3. **Hack Away:** Write your code, test it, and make sure everything is working as expected. If you're working on the **RAG** or **BM25** components, try not to break the existing retrieval logic.
4. **Push & Pull Request:** Push your branch to your fork and then open a **Pull Request (PR)** to this repository.

## 📝 A Few Ground Rules

* **Keep it Clean:** I'm a fan of clean code and clear comments. It makes life easier for everyone who reads your code later.
* **Small is Beautiful:** Try to keep your PRs focused on one thing. If you want to fix three different bugs, three separate PRs are much easier to review and merge than one giant one.
* **Life Happens, Bugs Happen:** If you find a bug but don't have time to fix it, just open an **Issue**. Detailed reports are just as valuable as code!

## 💬 Let’s Talk First

Before you start a major overhaul or a big new feature, it’s a good idea to drop a note in the **Discussions** tab. We can chat about the implementation details there so we’re on the same page before you put in the hard work.
